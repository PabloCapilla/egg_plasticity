## Code:

All R code is available in [`scripts`](https://github.com/PabloCapilla/egg_plasticity/tree/main/scripts), included in three sub-folder, each for one section of the manuscript. Scripts are numbered in order of use from 001 to 007. Scripts titles should be self-explanatory, but each script contains a description section with further information. The paths provided to import data sets into R assume your location is the main folder of the repository (i.e., the general folder `egg_plasticity`). The R version used for this project was 4.1.3.

## Folders:

[`data`](https://github.com/PabloCapilla/egg_plasticity/tree/main/data): data sets for analysis of egg mass, hatchling mass, egg volume, maternal provisioning rates, clutch size and total clutches per season.

[`scripts`](https://github.com/PabloCapilla/egg_plasticity/tree/main/scripts/):

-   [`01_egg_volume`](https://github.com/PabloCapilla/egg_plasticity/tree/main/scripts/01_egg_volume): scripts for egg volume analysis.
-   [`02_maternal_provisioning_rates`](https://github.com/PabloCapilla/egg_plasticity/tree/main/scripts/02_maternal_provisioning_rates): scripts for analysis of maternal provisioning rates.
